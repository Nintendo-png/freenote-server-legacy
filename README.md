The core PHP server Freenote is based on

## Workflow

1. Clone the repo's `develop` branch  
2. Make commits to your repo fork  
3. When you've made a group of changes that you want added to the server, create a Pull Request to the `develop` fork  
4. When the `develop` fork is stable, PR to the `master` branch. The `master` branch serves as the official server release

I know it's complex but it keeps bugs out.
