                   Welcome to Freenote!

We are still in beta stage, so expect more to come.

Be sure to check Mail frequently for updates.

Many mentioned features are still being implemented.

Firstly, we would like to thank you for giving us a try! 

Freenote is an alternative server to Flipnote Hatena, which was sadly shut down in 2013. 

There is another server as well, Sudomemo. But what makes us different from the others? 

The main thing that makes us different from Sudomemo is that we allow the posting of mature content. 

This, of course, needs limits if Freenote is to survive, as we saw with PBSDS's server, which was shut down due to illegal activity. 

But our rules are still very simple, and are in place to ensure that Freenote remains a fun, yet safe, place!

1. An illegal post in any channel or chatroom will result in an instant console ban, the removal of the post and Freenote Admins sharing your FSID and IP with Sudomemo Admins.

	-Anything pornographic or sexualy sugestive in anyway MUST be drawn (No camera usage in anyway) and posted in the NSFW channel.

	-We the Admins of Freenote do not know how the NSFW channel will workout, therefor we reserve the right the remove the NSFW channel (Or any aspect of Freenote).

2. Content that contains themes and or references that are considered inappropriate must be posted in the "Filth" channels. 

	-This is to prevent any issues or conflicts with people getting offended and or hurt by content that may be posted. 

	-Because as we stated, we want Freenote to be a pleasant experience for all who use it. 

	--Inappropriate content includes, but is not limited to,

		---Swearing

		---Nudity (Even for educational purposes)

		---"Edgy" humor, such as 9/11 jokes, Holocaust jokes, Racist jokes, etc.

		---Blood and gore. Small drops or cuts are allowed if you must, but excessive gore is considered filth.

3. Please do not spam. (We will eventualy patch this to make it impossible)  

	-Spam includes posting the same thing multiple times with little to no changes. 

	-It takes up a lot of room and hurts the server's fun.

By posting on Freenote, you are agreeing to follow the guidelines above. 

Failure to follow these guidelines WILL result in console ban (No, uninstalling/reinstalling Flipnote Studio will not bypass this ban) and Freenote Admins sharing your FSID and IP with Sudomemo Admins (If severe enough). 

Now that the rules are clear, be sure to follow them and help make this community a great one! 

Have fun expressing your creativity to it's fullest!
