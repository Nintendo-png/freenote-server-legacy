(I dont mean it should have absolutely no rules like pbdsds haha).			Won't it be sort of be like Sudo with more loose rules without the chaos of pbsds?			<br><br>			A: Not nearly as strict as Sudomemo.			The only rule is that you have to post anything sexual or cursing on the filth channel (Once it is implemented, until then don't).			Thanks for the question!			<br><br>			Reply: Ah nice nice, feels good to know that this server is going to be more laid back than Sudomemo, a bit tired of living in constant fear of being banned for a simple screw up y'know. Your site looks fantastic so far, just what I hoped it would be. Can't wait until its fully developed.			<br><br>			A: Thanks, bro!			<br><br>--<br><br>			Q: Will there be a adding star limit like on sudomemo with its 10 star limit?			<br><br>			A: Nope there won't, just don't add thousands of stars to your own flips. Lol.			<br><br>--<br><br>			Q: Will the "Creator's Room" be implemented sometime soon?			<br><br></p>		</div>	</body></html>
